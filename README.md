# Advanced Gold Trading Robot

This code is an example of the structure for an advanced gold trading robot in MQL5. The robot is designed to analyze market trends and make trading decisions based on the analysis.

## Dependencies

The code includes the necessary libraries and dependencies for trading. These include:

- `Trade.mqh` for trading functions
- - `ChartObjects.mqh` for chart object manipulation
  - - `Indicators.mqh` for technical indicators
   
    - ## Global Variables
   
    - The code defines some global variables that can be customized according to the trader's preferences. These variables include:
   
    - - `lotSize`: The initial lot size for trading
      - - `stopLoss`: The stop loss in pips
        - - `takeProfit`: The take profit in pips
         
          - ## Market Trend Analysis
         
          - The code includes a function `analyzeMarketTrend()` that implements algorithms to analyze market trends. The function should return `true` if the market trend is bullish and `false` if the trend is bearish.
         
          - ## Trading Decision-Making
         
          - The code includes a function `makeTradingDecision()` that makes trading decisions based on the market trend analysis. If the market trend is bullish, a buy trade is executed. If the trend is bearish, a sell trade is executed. The function also displays the trading decision on the chart.
         
          - ## User-Friendly Interface
         
          - The code includes a function `createUI()` that designs a user-friendly interface using `ChartObjects` functions. Traders can customize settings according to their preferences using this interface.
         
          - ## Real-Time Performance Tracking
         
          - The code includes a function `trackPerformance()` that integrates live trading signals from real accounts and provides traders with real results and performance tracking.
         
          - ## Entry Point
         
          - The entry point of the program is the `OnStart()` function. It calls the necessary functions `createUI()` and `trackPerformance()`. The main trading algorithm is then run in a loop while trade is allowed. The function `makeTradingDecision()` is called to make trading decisions, and there is a sleep interval of 5 seconds between each decision.
